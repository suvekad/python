------ INTRODUCTION ------
Python was created by Guido Van Rossum
Released in 1991
Used For: 
     1) Server-Side Development
     2) Software Development
     3) System Scripting
     4) Mathematics
------ WHAT ELSE PYTHON CAN DO ------
Connect to data base systems
Handle Big Data
Perform complex maths
Rapid prototyping
------ WHY WE NEED PYTHON ------
Run on interpreter system
Simple syntax
Works on different platform
Treated in:    i) Procedural way
	          ii) Object-Oriented way
 	         iii) Functional way
------ MODES IN PYTHON ------
There are two modes in python, 
they are:
A.	Interactive Mode
B.	Script Mode
------ INTERACTIVE MODES ------
" >>> " --> this indicates that the python shell is ready to execute
Example :
>>> print(“ python ”)
>>> python
>>> print(5+10)
>>> 15
This mode act as a calculator
Known as REPL (Read, Evaluate, Print, and Loop)
Quick way of running blocks
Single line python code
The result immediately displayed
Codes cannot be modified
------ SCRIPT MODE ------
To open this mode:
	Open IDLE  ctrl N (or) go to file  new file
For long code this mode can be used
Can use any text editor
Codes can be edited in a direct way
------ SYNTAX IN PYTHON ------
In python, syntax is designed for readability
Does not use often semicolon or parentheses to complete a block of code
Relies on indentation, using white spaces to define scope, such as loops, functions and classes
